                        <p class="mt-3">I am currently a student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) pursuing a career as a licensed clinical counsellor. My interests include trauma-informed practice, addictions, career counselling & coaching, and increasing access to effective mental healthcare.</p>
                        <p>Working with others from marginalized backgrounds has allowed me to see beyond my struggles and learn how others thrive amidst adversity. As a UBC student, I pay particular attention to content and research that investigates trauma because I believe this to be a core issue which many other problems stem from. In my profession as a GS Career Student Advisor, at UBC’s Centre for Student Involvement & Careers (CISC), I am interested in effective techniques that will support adults in making insightful transitions towards meaningful and fulfilling lives.</p>
